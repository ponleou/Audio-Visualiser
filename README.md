## Overview

This is a lightweight, TUI application used for visualising audio in frequency bands or waveforms in real-time. The application can visualise audio input from the audio device's input, and also play and visualise audio files. The program has a built-in real-time audio resampling algorithm (linear interpolation), allowing it to support any sample rate from the audio device and audio files.
